# Predicting S&P500 trends with Machine Learning

Source data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500

## Importance
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) is the most commonly used benchmark for determining the state of the overall economy. Many investors also use the S&P 500 as a benchmark for their individual portfolios. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) used to be the main gauge of economic health for the U.S., but that index only contains 30 companies and is limited in the sectors it represents. The S&P 500 has become the leading stock index due to its broader scope [[Source]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041315/what-are-pros-and-cons-using-sp-500-benchmark.asp#:~:text=The%20S%26P%20500%20is%20largely,of%20the%20American%20corporate%20economy)

## Questions
1. Is there a difference between the annual average return between the 5 years of data?
2. What is the impact of the 5 leading companies in the direction of the S&P500?
3. What is the association between opening stock prices based on volume?
4. What is the association between closing stock prices on volume?

## Technologies Used
### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

### Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is 90/10. 

### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard.

## Communication Protocols
- Team members will communicate using the #final-project Slack channel.
- Team members will meet at least 1x per week.
- Team members will plan next time they meet at the end of every meeting-- being flexible and open to each other's schedules.
- Team members will communicate with each other in the case they need internal deadline extensions or help with their part of the project.
- Team members will distribute work evenly amongst each other and be repsonsible for their distribution.
